## 🌟 Professional Principles
### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
I ensure that my code is modular and reusable, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.
### SOLID Principles
I adhere to the five SOLID principles to write scalable and maintainable code:
- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each class or module has a single, well-defined responsibility.
- **Open/Closed Principle:** Software entities are open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle:** Objects of a superclass can be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
- **Interface Segregation Principle:** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
### Clean Code
I follow Clean Code practices to ensure my code is easy to read, understand, and maintain. This includes writing meaningful variable names, keeping functions small and focused, and continuously refactoring code to improve its structure and clarity.
### Code Review
I participate in and advocate for regular code reviews. This practice not only improves code quality but also fosters knowledge sharing and collaboration within the team.
